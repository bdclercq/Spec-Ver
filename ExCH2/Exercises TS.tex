\section*{Ex. 2.2}
\subsection*{Question}
We are given three (primitive) processes $P_1, P_2,$ and $P_3$ with shared integer variable x. The program of process $P_i$ is as follows:\\
\begin{centering}
	\includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{algo1.png}
\end{centering}
\\
That is, $P_i$ executes ten times the assignment x := x+1. The assignment x := x+1 is realized using the three actions LOAD(x), INC(x) and STORE(x). Consider now the parallel program:\\
\begin{centering}
	\includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{algo2.png}
\end{centering}
\\
Does P have an execution that halts with the terminal value x = 2?

\subsection*{Answer}
The answer to this question depends on how you interpret the question.\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item If you allow processess to run completely independent from each other, it is possible to have an execution that halts with x = 2:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item First load x := 0 in $P_1, P_2, P_3$
		\item Then let $P_1$ finish (x == 10)
		\item After that, let $P_2$ run 9 times and store x = 9
		\item Increment $P_3$ 1 time and store
		\item Load x := 1 stored by $P_3$ in $P_2$ 
		\item Load x := 1 in $P_3$
		\item Finish $P_3$ before $P_2$ to end with x == 2
	\end{itemize}
	\item If you don't allow this and expect processes to wait until all others have finished their loop then it isn't possible.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Ex. 2.4}
\subsection*{Question}
Show that the handshaking operator $\|$ that forces two transition systems to
synchronize over their common actions (see Definition 2.26 on page 48) is associative. That is,
show that
$(TS_1\|TS_2)\|TS_3 = TS_1\|(TS_2\|TS_3)$
where $TS_1, TS_2, TS_3$ are arbitrary transition systems.

\subsection*{Answer}
$\begin{array}{lcl}
	(TS_1\|TS_2)\|TS_3 & = & (S_1\times S_2, Act_1 \times Act_2, ->, I_1 \times I_2, AP_1\cup AP_2, L)\|TS_3\\

\section*{Ex. 2.5}
\subsection*{Question}
The following program is a mutual exclusion protocol for two processes due to
Pnueli [118]. There is a single shared variable s which is either 0 or 1, and initially 1. Besides,
each process has a local Boolean variable y that initially equals 0. The program text for process
$P_i$ (i = 0, 1) is as follows:\\
\begin{centering}
	\includegraphics*[scale=1]{ex25.png}
\end{centering}\\
Here, the statement $(y_i, s) := (1, i)$; is a multiple assignment in which variable $y_i := 1$ and $s := i$
is a single, atomic step.\\
(a) Define the program graph of a process in Pnueli´s algorithm.\\
(b) Determine the transition system for each process.\\
(c) Construct their parallel composition.\\
(d) Check whether the algorithm ensures mutual exclusion.\\
(e) Check whether the algorithm ensures starvation freedom.\\

\subsection*{Answer}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \begin{centering}
		\includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{25a.png}

	\item \begin{centering}
		\includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{25b.png}

	\item \begin{centering}
		\includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{25c.png}
	\end{centering}
	\item P = $\{CRIT_1, CRIT_2, r_1, r_2\}$\\
		ME is ensured: it cannot happen that 2 processes execute the critical section at the same time due to the \textbf{wait} condition.
	\item Starvation freedom is not ensured: it may happen that a process is always surpassed by one or more other processes.

\subsection*{Question}
Consider a stack of nonnegative integers with capacity n (for some fixed n).\\
(a) Give a transition system representation of this stack. You may abstract from the values on
the stack and use the operations top, pop, and push with their usual meaning.\\
(b) Sketch a transition system representation of the stack in which the concrete stack content is
explicitly represented.

\section*{Ex. 2.7}
\subsection*{Question}
Consider the following generalization of Peterson’s mutual exclusion algorithm
that is aimed at an arbitrary number n (n $\geq$ 2) processes.\\
The basic concept of the algorithm is that each process passes through n “levels” before acquiring access to the critical section. The concurrent processes share the bounded integer arrays y[0..n−1] and p[1..n] with y[i] ∈ {1, . . . , n } and p[i] ∈ {0, . . . , n−1 }. \\
y[j] = i means that process i has the lowest priority at level j, and p[i] = j expresses that process i is currently at level j. Process i starts at level 0. \\
On requesting access to the critical section, the process passes through levels 1 through n−1. Process i waits at
level j until either all other processes are at a lower level (i.e., p[k] $<$ j for all k $\neq$ i) or another
process grants process i access to its critical section (i.e., y[j] $\neq$ i). The behavior of process i is in
pseudocode:\\
\begin{centering}
	\includegraphics*[scale=0.8]{ex27.png}
\end{centering}\\
(a) Give the program graph for process i.\\
(b) Determine the number of states (including the unreachable states) in the parallel composition
of n processes.\\
(c) Prove that this algorithm ensures mutual exclusion for n processes.\\
(d) Prove that it is impossible that all processes are waiting in the for-iteration.\\
(e) Establish whether it is possible that a process that wants to enter the critical section waits
ad infinitum.\\

\subsection*{Answer}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \begin{centering}
		\includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{27a.png}
	\end{centering}
	\item Each processes has 5 states.\\
	Combining 2 processes gives $5^2 = 25$ (each state can be combined with 5 other states) possible states, combining 3 processes gives $5^3$ possible states, ... $\Rightarrow$ combining n processes gives $5^n$ possible states.
	\item /
	\item /
	\item Either a process will enter the critical section because it doesn't have the lowest priority ($y[j] \neq i$) OR because all other processes exited the critical section. Assuming that every process will leave the critical section after a reasonable amount of time, a process will never have to wait ad infinitum to enter the critical section.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Ex. 2.8}
\subsection*{Question}
In channel systems, values can be transferred from one process to another process.\\
As this is somewhat limited, we consider in this exercise an extension that allows for the transfer
of expressions.\\
That is to say, the send and receive statements c!v and c?x (where x and v are of
the same type) are generalized into c!expr and c?x, where for simplicity it is assumed that expr
is a correctly typed expression (of the same type as x). Legal expressions are, e.g., x $\wedge$ ($\neg$y $\lor$ z)
for Boolean variables x, y, and z, and channel c with dom(c) = $\{$ 0, 1 $\}$. For integers x, y, and an
integer-channel c, $|$2x + (x − y)div17$|$ is a legal expression.\\
\\
Extend the transition system semantics of channel systems such that expressions are
allowed in send statements.
\subsection*{Answer}
\begin{itemize}
	\item S needs to be extended with Eval(expr)
	\item The relation '$\rightarrow$' needs to be extended with Eval(expr) where it states `a value along channel c'
	\item L needs to be extended with Cond(expr)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Ex. 2.9}
\subsection*{Question}
Consider the following mutual exclusion algorithm that uses the shared variables
y1 and y2 (initially both 0).\\
\begin{centering}
	\includegraphics*[scale=1]{ex29.png}
\end{centering}
\\
(a) Give the program graph representations of both processes. (A pictorial representation suffices.)\\
(b) Give the reachable part of the transition system of P1 $\|$ P2 where y1 $\leq$ 2 and y2 $\leq$ 2.\\
(c) Describe an execution that shows that the entire transition system is infinite.\\
(d) Check whether the algorithm indeed ensures mutual exclusion.\\
(e) Check whether the algorithm never reaches a state in which both processes are mutually
waiting for each other.\\
(f) Is it possible that a process that wants to enter the critical section has to wait ad infinitum?\\
\subsection*{Answer}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \begin{centering}
		\includegraphics*[scale=1]{29a.jpg}
	\end{centering}
	\item \begin{centering}
		\includegraphics*[scale=1]{29b.jpg}
	\end{centering}
	\item $P_1 -> P_2 -> P_1 -> P_2 -> ...$ basically just eternally switching between increasing y1 and y2 before the other can gain access to the critical section
	\item A process can only enter the critical section if the other process just left the critical section or if the counter of process i is smaller then that of process j. Since a process can only make its own counter greater than that of the other process, it will only get access if the other process left the critical section. If process i increments it counter before process j, process j will have access to the CS before process i.         
	\item Due to the way the counters increment it cannot happen that both processes are mutually waiting for each other.
	\item No: either the other process has their counter set to 0 or it wants access to the CS next.

\section*{Ex. 2.10}
\subsection*{Question}
Consider the following mutual exclusion algorithm that was proposed 1966 [221]
as a simplification of Dijkstra’s mutual exclusion algorithm in case there are just two processes:\\
\begin{centering}
	\includegraphics*[scale=0.8]{ex210.png}

Here C0, C1, and C2 are program labels, and the word “computer” should be interpreted as process.\\

(a) Give the program graph representations for a single process. (A pictorial representation
suffices.)\\
(b) Give the reachable part of the transition system of P1 $\|$ P2.\\

\begin{centering}
	\includegraphics*[scale=0.8]{ex211.png}

\\
(a) Give the transition system representation TS(C1) of the circuit C1.\\
(b) Let TS(C2) be the transition system of the circuit C2. Outline the transition system TS(C1) $\otimes$
TS(C2).

\subsection*{Answer}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \begin{centering}
		\includegraphics*[scale=0.45]{211a.jpg}
	\end{centering}
	\item C1 will get an extra line from r1 to an OR gate (other input is result of ´r1 AND r2'). Result of the OR gate goes to y and is negated by a NOT gate before going to an OR gate that leads to r1 (along with the original input for r1).
